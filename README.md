# Robot-Path-Planing

For an Occupancy Grid Map output from a SLAM algorithm, implement either __A* path planning__ algorithm for a specified goal position as a service provider (provide the goal
position as input and obtain the path to goal as response). 

Use the LiDAR data for generating the map with the SLAM node in ROS.
